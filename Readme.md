# bladeGPS

Very crude experimental implimentation of [gps-sdr-sim](https://github.com/osqzss/gps-sdr-sim) for real-time signal generation.
The code works with bladeRF and has been tested on Windows only.

```
Usage: bladegps [options]
Options:
  -e <gps_nav>     RINEX navigation file for GPS ephemerides (required)
  -u <user_motion> User motion file (dynamic mode)
  -g <nmea_gga>    NMEA GGA stream (dynamic mode)
  -l <location>    Lat,Lon,Hgt (static mode) e.g. 35.274,137.014,100
  -t <date,time>   Scenario start time YYYY/MM/DD,hh:mm:ss
  -T <date,time>   Overwrite TOC and TOE to scenario start time
  -d <duration>    Duration [sec] (max: 86400)
  -x <XB_number>   Enable XB board, e.g. '-x 200' for XB200
  -i               Interactive mode: North='w', South='s', East='d', West='a'
  -I               Disable ionospheric delay for spacecraft scenario
```

### Build on Windows with Visual Studio

Follow the instructions at [Nuand wiki page](https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF/wiki/Getting-Started%3A-Windows) and build the bladeRF library from the source with Visual Studio 2013 Express for Windows Desktop. Assume you already downloaded pthread and libusb files and successfully built the bladeRF library for your Windows environment.

1. Start Visual Studio.
2. Create an empty project for a console application.
3. On the _Solution Explorer_ at right, add the following files to the project:
 * __bladegps.c__ and __bladegps.h__
 * __gpssim.c__ and __gpssim.h__
 * __getopt.c__ and __getopt.h__
4. Add the paths to the following folders in `Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directories`:
 * __pthreads-w32-2-9-1-release/Pre-built.2/include__ for pthread.h
 * __bladeRF/include__ for libbladeRF.h
5. Add the paths to the following folders in `Configuration Properties -> Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories`:
 * __pthreads-w32-2-9-1-release/Pre-built.2/lib/x64__ for pthreadVC2.lib
 * __bladeRF/x64__ for bladeRF.lib
6. Specify the name of the additional libraries in `Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies`:
 * __pthreadVC2.lib__
 * __bladeRF.lib__
7. Select __Release__ in the _Solution Configurations_ drop-down list.
8. Select __X64__ in the _Sofution Platforms_ drop-down list.
9. Run `Build -> Build Solution`

After a successful build, you can find the executable in the __Release__ folder. You should put the copies of the following DLLs in the same folder to run the code:
* __bladeRF.dll__
* __libusb-1.0.dll__
* __pthreadVC2.dll__


### Build on Windows - Instructions Courtesy of OSQZSS

You can find the instructions to build the bladeRF library from the source with Visual Studio 2013 Express for Windows Desktop in the Nuand wiki page:
https://github.com/Nuand/bladeRF/wiki/Getting-Started%3A-Windows

Assume you already downloaded pthread and libusb files and successfully built the bladeRF library.

In order to build bladeGPS, you need to add the paths to the following folders in Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> General -> Additional Include Directoris:

“pthreads-w32-2-9-1-release/Pre-built.2/include” for pthread.h
“bladeRF/include” for libbladeRF.h
You also need to add the paths to the following folders in Configuration Properties -> Linker -> General -> Additional Library Directories:

“pthreads-w32-2-9-1-release/Pre-built.2/lib/x64” for pthreadVC2.lib
“bladeRF/x64” for bladeRF.lib
For the link command, specify the name of the additional libraries in Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies:

pthreadVC2.lib
bladeRF.lib
Basically that's it! Now you should be able to build the code. In order to execute bladeGPS, you need the following DLLs in the same folder:

bladeRF.dll
libusb-1.0.dll
pthreadVC2.dll

### Build on Linux (Untested)

1. Retrive the bladeRF source in a directory next to the current directory.

 ```
$ cd ..
$ git clone git@github.com:Nuand/bladeRF.git
```

2. Build the bladeRF host library.

 ```
$ cd bladeRF/host
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

3. Build bladeGPS.

 ```
$ cd ../../../bladeGPS
$ make
```
